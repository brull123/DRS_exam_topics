\section{Enumerate the stages of the traditional (offline) web search. Explain how the algorithms used in modern web search engines such as Google differ from the traditional web search.}
\section{Explain the web crawling procedure. Give examples of advanced techniques that facilitate the web crawling process.}
\section{Describe the process of indexing in web search, both the simple version and its possible extensions.}
\section{Describe simple search in distributed databases. What is its complexity if the file is present only on a single computer in the network? How does the complexity change if the file exists on a fixed fraction of computers in the network?}
\section{Explain how supernodes improve the search in distributed networks.}
\section{Describe the two models of message passing, i.e., the Kleinberg's model and the hierarchical model, and enumerate their limitations (assumptions). What is the complexity of message passing in these models?}
\section{Elaborate on the constraints that have to be imposed on networks as the main conclusion of message passing analysis using models.}
